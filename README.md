# Spaceship NES
This a test to learn how in the past they made games, spoiler alert it was in assembly, so I'm trying to learn how to make a basic arcade game with the help of book.famicon.party and learning how, in the process, learn some assembly and how the NES works.

## How to compile .nes
If you want to use my code and change things to compile the .nes just use the assemble.sh file to create it!
NOTE: It only works on Linux if you are using Windows you'll have to do it manual
